Since the wall is frictionless, there is no vertical friction force from the wall.\n\n**2. Equilibrium Conditions:**\n\n*   **Sum of forces in the x-direction (horizontal equilibrium):**\n    $\\Sigma F_x = 0 \\implies f_s - N_w = 0$\n    $f_s = N_w$  (Equation 1)\n\n*   **Sum of forces in the y-direction (vertical equilibrium):**\n    $\\Sigma F_y = 0 \\implies N_g - W = 0$\n    $N_g = W = Mg$ (Equation 2)\n\n*   **Sum of torques (rotational equilibrium):**\n    We choose the pivot point at the base of the ladder (where it touches the ground). This eliminates $N_g$ and $f_s$ from the torque equation.\n    The forces causing torque about this pivot are the weight (W) and the normal force from the wall ($N_w$).\n    *   Torque due to weight (clockwise): $\\tau_W = W \\times (\\text{perpendicular distance from pivot to W})$\n        The horizontal distance from the pivot to the line of action of W is $(L/2) \\cos \\theta$.\n        $\\tau_W = W (L/2) \\cos \\theta$\n    *   Torque due to normal force from wall (counter-clockwise): $\\tau_{N_w} = N_w \\times (\\text{perpendicular distance from pivot to } N_w)$\n        The vertical distance from the pivot to the line of action of $N_w$ is $L \\sin \\theta$.\n        $\\tau_{N_w} = N_w L \\sin \\theta$\n\n    For equilibrium, $\\Sigma \\tau = 0$:\n    $N_w L \\sin \\theta - W (L/2) \\cos \\theta = 0$\n    $N_w L \\sin \\theta = W (L/2) \\cos \\theta$ (Equation 3)\n\n**3.

Sanity Check:**\n*   The coefficient of friction is dimensionless, which is correct.\n*   If the angle $\\theta$ were smaller (ladder flatter), $\\tan \\theta$ would be smaller, leading to a larger $\\mu_s$. This makes sense, as a flatter ladder is more prone to slipping and requires more friction.\n*   If the angle $\\theta$ were larger (ladder more vertical), $\\tan \\theta$ would be larger, leading to a smaller $\\mu_s$. If $\\theta \\to 90^\\circ$, $\\tan \\theta \\to \\infty$, so $\\mu_s \\to 0$, which is also physically reasonable as a vertical ladder against a frictionless wall would not tend to slip horizontally.\n*   The value 0.289 is a realistic coefficient of static friction for many surfaces.\n\nThe derivation is consistent and the result is physically plausible.",

The market price P = 100 - 67.5 = 32.5. Each firm's profit would be (Price - MC) * Quantity = (32.5 - 10) * 22.5 = 22.5 * 22.5 = 506.25. To confirm this is a Nash equilibrium, we check if any firm has an incentive to deviate. If firm 1 assumes q2=22.5 and q3=22.5, its optimal quantity q1 according to its reaction function would be (90 - 22.5 - 22.5)/2 = (90 - 45)/2 = 45/2 = 22.5. Since firm 1's optimal quantity matches the equilibrium quantity, no firm has an incentive to deviate, thereby confirming the Nash equilibrium.",

        "refined_solution": "To find the equilibrium quantity for each firm in a Cournot competition model, we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Define the Profit Function for a Generic Firm (Firm i):**\n    The market demand curve is P = 100 - Q. There are 3 firms, so Q = q1 + q2 + q3. Each firm has a marginal cost (MC) of 10.\n    The profit for firm i (π_i) is given by (Price - Marginal Cost) * Quantity_i.\n    π_i = (P - MC) * q_i\n    Substitute P = 100 - (q_i + q_j + q_k) and MC = 10:\n    π_i = (100 - (q_i + q_j + q_k) - 10) * q_i\n    π_i = (90 - q_i - q_j - q_k) * q_i\n    π_i = 90q_i - q_i^2 - q_j*q_i - q_k*q_i\n    *Counterexample Check*: The profit function derivation is standard. To falsify, one would need to show an error in the substitution of P or MC, or in the basic definition of profit. The algebra for expanding the terms is also straightforward. No counterexample found; the algebra is correct.\n\n2.  **Derive the Reaction Function for Firm i:**\n    Each firm maximizes its profit by choosing its own quantity, taking the quantities of other firms as given. We find the first-order condition by taking the derivative of π_i with respect to q_i and setting it to zero:\n    d(π_i)/d(q_i) = 90 - 2q_i - q_j - q_k = 0\n    Now, solve for q_i to get the reaction function:\n    2q_i = 90 - q_j - q_k\n    q_i = (90 - q_j - q_k) / 2\n    *Counterexample Check*: To falsify, one would need to demonstrate an error in the differentiation (treating q_j and q_k as constants) or in the subsequent algebraic rearrangement. Both steps are fundamental calculus and algebra. No counterexample found.\n\n3.  **Apply Symmetry for Cournot Equilibrium:**\n    In a symmetric Cournot equilibrium with identical firms and costs, all firms will produce the same quantity. Therefore, q1 = q2 = q3 = q*.\n    Substitute q* for q_i, q_j, and q_k into the reaction function:\n    q* = (90 - q* - q*) / 2\n    q* = (90 - 2q*) / 2\n    *Counterexample Check*: The assumption of symmetry is valid because the problem states all 3 firms have the same marginal cost (MC=10) and face the same market conditions. If firms had different cost structures or capacities, symmetry would not hold, and a system of distinct reaction functions would need to be solved. Given the problem's parameters, the assumption is appropriate. No counterexample found.\n\n4.  **Solve for the Equilibrium Quantity (q*):**\n    Now, solve the equation for q*:\n    2q* = 90 - 2q*\n    Add 2q* to both sides:\n    4q* = 90\n    Divide by 4:\n    q* = 90 / 4\n    q* = 22.5\n    *Counterexample Check*: This is a basic linear equation. To falsify, one would need to show an error in the arithmetic operations (addition, division). The algebraic solution is straightforward and correct. No counterexample found.\n\nThus, the equilibrium quantity for each firm is 22.5 units.",
