        "solution": "To determine the minimum coefficient of static friction at the ground to prevent the ladder from slipping, we will use the conditions for static equilibrium.\n\n**1. Free-Body Diagram and Forces:**\nLet L be the length of the ladder and m be its mass. The ladder makes an angle θ = 60° with the ground. We assume the ladder is uniform, so its weight acts at its center of mass, L/2 from the base.\n\nThe forces acting on the ladder are:\n*   **W = mg:** Weight of the ladder, acting vertically downwards at L/2 from the base.\n*   **N_g:** Normal force from the ground, acting vertically upwards at the base.\n*   **f_s:** Static friction force from the ground, acting horizontally towards the wall at the base (to prevent the base from slipping away from the wall).\n*   **N_w:** Normal force from the wall, acting horizontally away from the wall at the top of the ladder. Since the wall is frictionless, there is no vertical friction force from the wall.\n\n**2. Conditions for Static Equilibrium:**\nFor the ladder to be in static equilibrium, the net force and net torque must be zero.\n\n*   **Sum of forces in the x-direction (horizontal):**\n    ΣF_x = 0\n    f_s - N_w = 0\n    f_s = N_w  (Equation 1)\n\n*   **Sum of forces in the y-direction (vertical):**\n    ΣF_y = 0\n    N_g - W = 0\n    N_g = W = mg  (Equation 2)\n\n*   **Sum of torques about a convenient pivot point:**\n    Let's choose the pivot point at the base of the ladder (where N_g and f_s act). This eliminates N_g and f_s from the torque equation.\n    The torques are:\n    *   Torque due to W: The perpendicular distance from the pivot to the line of action of W is (L/2)cos(θ). This torque tends to cause clockwise rotation (negative).\n        τ_W = - W * (L/2)cos(θ)\n    *   Torque due to N_w: The perpendicular distance from the pivot to the line of action of N_w is Lsin(θ). This torque tends to cause counter-clockwise rotation (positive).\n        τ_Nw = N_w * Lsin(θ)\n\n    Στ = 0\n    N_w * Lsin(θ) - W * (L/2)cos(θ) = 0  (Equation 3)\n\n**3. Solving the Equations:**\n\nFrom Equation 3:\nN_w * Lsin(θ) = W * (L/2)cos(θ)\nDivide both sides by L:\nN_w * sin(θ) = W * (1/2)cos(θ)\nN_w = W * (1/2) * (cos(θ) / sin(θ))\nN_w = W * (1/2) * cot(θ)\n\nNow, substitute W = mg from Equation 2:\nN_w = mg * (1/2) * cot(θ)\n\nFrom Equation 1, we know f_s = N_w. So:\nf_s = mg * (1/2) * cot(θ)\n\nThe condition for preventing slipping is that the static friction force must be less than or equal to the maximum possible static friction:\nf_s ≤ μ_s * N_g\n\nFor the *minimum* coefficient of static friction (μ_s_min) required to prevent slipping, we set f_s equal to μ_s_min * N_g:\nμ_s_min = f_s / N_g\n\nSubstitute the expressions for f_s and N_g:\nμ_s_min = [mg * (1/2) * cot(θ)] / [mg]\nμ_s_min = (1/2) * cot(θ)\n\n**4. Plugging in the Values:**\n\nGiven θ = 60 degrees.\ncot(60°) = 1 / tan(60°) = 1 / √3\n\nμ_s_min = (1/2) * (1/√3)\nμ_s_min = 1 / (2√3)\n\nTo rationalize the denominator, multiply the numerator and denominator by √3:\nμ_s_min = √3 / (2 * 3)\nμ_s_min = √3 / 6\n\nUsing √3 ≈ 1.73205:\nμ_s_min ≈ 1.73205 / 6\nμ_s_min ≈ 0.288675\n\n**5. Sanity Check:**\n*   The units are dimensionless, which is correct for a coefficient of friction.\n*   The mass of the ladder (m) and its length (L) cancel out, indicating that the minimum coefficient of friction depends only on the angle, which is expected for this setup.\n*   If θ were 90° (vertical ladder), cot(90°) = 0, so μ_s_min = 0. This makes sense as a perfectly vertical ladder doesn't need friction to prevent slipping at the base.\n*   If θ were 0° (horizontal ladder), cot(0°) is undefined (approaches infinity), so μ_s_min would approach infinity. This also makes sense as a nearly horizontal ladder would be very unstable and require immense friction.\n*   A value of approximately 0.289 is a reasonable coefficient of friction.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{0.289}$",

        "refined_solution": "To determine the minimum coefficient of static friction at the ground to prevent the ladder from slipping, we will use the conditions for static equilibrium.\n\n**1. Free-Body Diagram and Forces:**\nLet L be the length of the ladder and m be its mass. The ladder makes an angle θ = 60° with the ground. We assume the ladder is uniform, so its weight acts at its center of mass, L/2 from the base.\n\nThe forces acting on the ladder are:\n*   **W = mg:** Weight of the ladder, acting vertically downwards at L/2 from the base.\n*   **N_g:** Normal force from the ground, acting vertically upwards at the base.\n*   **f_s:** Static friction force from the ground, acting horizontally towards the wall at the base (to prevent the base from slipping away from the wall).\n*   **N_w:** Normal force from the wall, acting horizontally away from the wall at the top of the ladder. Since the wall is frictionless, there is no vertical friction force from the wall.\n\n**2. Conditions for Static Equilibrium:**\nFor the ladder to be in static equilibrium, the net force and net torque must be zero.\n\n*   **Sum of forces in the x-direction (horizontal):**\n    ΣF_x = 0\n    f_s - N_w = 0\n    f_s = N_w  (Equation 1)\n\n*   **Sum of forces in the y-direction (vertical):**\n    ΣF_y = 0\n    N_g - W = 0\n    N_g = W = mg  (Equation 2)\n\n*   **Sum of torques about a convenient pivot point:**\n    Let's choose the pivot point at the base of the ladder (where N_g and f_s act). This eliminates N_g and f_s from the torque equation.\n    The torques are:\n    *   Torque due to W: The perpendicular distance from the pivot to the line of action of W is (L/2)cos(θ). This torque tends to cause clockwise rotation (negative).\n        τ_W = - W * (L/2)cos(θ)\n    *   Torque due to N_w: The perpendicular distance from the pivot to the line of action of N_w is Lsin(θ). This torque tends to cause counter-clockwise rotation (positive).\n        τ_Nw = N_w * Lsin(θ)\n\n    Στ = 0\n    N_w * Lsin(θ) - W * (L/2)cos(θ) = 0  (Equation 3)\n\n**3. Solving the Equations:**\n\nFrom Equation 3:\nN_w * Lsin(θ) = W * (L/2)cos(θ)\nDivide both sides by L:\nN_w * sin(θ) = W * (1/2)cos(θ)\nN_w = W * (1/2) * (cos(θ) / sin(θ))\nN_w = W * (1/2) * cot(θ)\n\nNow, substitute W = mg from Equation 2:\nN_w = mg * (1/2) * cot(θ)\n\nFrom Equation 1, we know f_s = N_w. So:\nf_s = mg * (1/2) * cot(θ)\n\nThe condition for preventing slipping is that the static friction force must be less than or equal to the maximum possible static friction:\nf_s ≤ μ_s * N_g\n\nFor the *minimum* coefficient of static friction (μ_s_min) required to prevent slipping, we set f_s equal to μ_s_min * N_g:\nμ_s_min = f_s / N_g\n\nSubstitute the expressions for f_s and N_g:\nμ_s_min = [mg * (1/2) * cot(θ)] / [mg]\nμ_s_min = (1/2) * cot(θ)\n\n**4. Plugging in the Values:**\n\nGiven θ = 60 degrees.\ncot(60°) = 1 / tan(60°) = 1 / √3\n\nμ_s_min = (1/2) * (1/√3)\nμ_s_min = 1 / (2√3)\n\nTo rationalize the denominator, multiply the numerator and denominator by √3:\nμ_s_min = √3 / (2 * 3)\nμ_s_min = √3 / 6\n\nUsing √3 ≈ 1.73205:\nμ_s_min ≈ 1.73205 / 6\nμ_s_min ≈ 0.288675\n\n**5. Sanity Check:**\n*   The units are dimensionless, which is correct for a coefficient of friction.\n*   The mass of the ladder (m) and its length (L) cancel out, indicating that the minimum coefficient of friction depends only on the angle, which is expected for this setup.\n*   If θ were 90° (vertical ladder), cot(90°) = 0, so μ_s_min = 0. This makes sense as a perfectly vertical ladder doesn't need friction to prevent slipping at the base.\n*   If θ were 0° (horizontal ladder), cot(0°) is undefined (approaches infinity), so μ_s_min would approach infinity. This also makes sense as a nearly horizontal ladder would be very unstable and require immense friction.\n*   A value of approximately 0.289 is a reasonable coefficient of friction.",

In a Nash equilibrium, each firm will produce the same quantity, i.e., q1 = q2 = q3 = q*.\nSubstitute q* into the reaction function for firm 1:\nq* = (90 - q* - q*) / 2\nq* = (90 - 2q*) / 2\n\n**Step 5: Solve for the equilibrium quantity q*.**\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n2q* = 90 - 2q*\nAdd 2q* to both sides:\n4q* = 90\nDivide by 4:\nq* = 90 / 4\nq* = 22.5\n\nThus, the equilibrium quantity for each firm is 22.5 units.\n\n**Sanity Check:**\nIf q2 = 22.5 and q3 = 22.5, then firm 1's optimal quantity is:\nq1 = (90 - 22.5 - 22.5) / 2\nq1 = (90 - 45) / 2\nq1 = 45 / 2\nq1 = 22.5\nThis confirms that if the other firms produce 22.5 units, firm 1's best response is also 22.5 units, indicating a stable Nash equilibrium.",

Since -2 < 0, this confirms that the first-order condition yields a profit maximum.\n\nRearranging this equation to solve for q1 gives firm 1's reaction function:\n2q1 = 90 - q2 - q3\nq1 = (90 - q2 - q3) / 2\n\n**Step 4: Apply symmetry to find the equilibrium quantities.**\nSince all three firms have identical cost structures and face the same market demand, their reaction functions will be symmetric. In a Nash equilibrium, each firm will produce the same quantity, i.e., q1 = q2 = q3 = q*. This is because, given the identical cost structures and market conditions, no firm would have an incentive to unilaterally deviate from this quantity, assuming the others also produce q*.\n\nSubstitute q* into the reaction function for firm 1:\nq* = (90 - q* - q*) / 2\nq* = (90 - 2q*) / 2\n\n**Step 5: Solve for the equilibrium quantity q*.**\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n2q* = 90 - 2q*\nAdd 2q* to both sides:\n4q* = 90\nDivide by 4:\nq* = 90 / 4\nq* = 22.5\n\nThus, the equilibrium quantity for each firm is 22.5 units.\n\n**Economic Viability Check:**\nTotal equilibrium quantity Q = q1 + q2 + q3 = 3 * 22.5 = 67.5.\nMarket price P = 100 - Q = 100 - 67.5 = 32.5.\nSince the market price P (32.5) is greater than the marginal cost MC (10), firms are making a positive profit, and the individual quantities (22.5) are positive. This confirms the economic viability of the solution.\n\n**Sanity Check:**\nIf q2 = 22.5 and q3 = 22.5, then firm 1's optimal quantity is:\nq1 = (90 - 22.5 - 22.5) / 2\nq1 = (90 - 45) / 2\nq1 = 45 / 2\nq1 = 22.5\nThis confirms that if the other firms produce 22.5 units, firm 1's best response is also 22.5 units, indicating a stable Nash equilibrium.",
